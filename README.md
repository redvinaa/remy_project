# Robotic manipulators task

I got this task as part of an interview process to Remy Robotics in 2022. I didn't have any experience with robotic manipulators back then, but I realize it is quite a useful skill, so I decided to revisit it to practice and gain insight. See task description in task_decription.pdf.
